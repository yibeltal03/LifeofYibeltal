In our project we have a driver class that runs the hash function we created.
Each hash has differnt number and can be change in the add functions.We created two
add functions add1(T item) and add(T item) where we can test a hash function by replacing it.
Test different hash fucntion by changing the the hash function used in the add function.

EX:

public void add(item){
int index = hash1(item)
//can change the function to differnt hash fucntion like
int index = hash2(item) 
}



Watte094: worked on hash function #1,2,33
- worked on add();
- worked on display();

Osono003: worked on has function #3,4,11
- worded on add1();
- worked on the driver class
